Process and Development Flow:

1. Project Setup:

Create a new ASP.NET Core web application.

Set up a basic Razor Pages project.



2. Data Management Setup:

Use a JSON file (e.g., products.json) to store product data temporarily.

Create a Models folder to define a Product class with fields like ID, Maker, and Image URL.

Use JSON serialization and deserialization to read and write product data.



3. Service Creation (Single Responsibility Principle):

Create a Services folder and add a JsonFileProductService class.

This service will be responsible for reading product data from the JSON file and converting it into a list of Product objects.

Register this service in ASP.NET Core’s dependency injection container so it can be injected into Razor Pages.



4. Razor Page Integration:

Inject the JsonFileProductService into a Razor Page Model.

Fetch product data using the service and pass it to the Razor Page for rendering.

Use Razor syntax to dynamically display product data (like product name, image, and description) in HTML.



5. Bootstrap and CSS Integration:

Use Bootstrap’s card layout (like card-columns) to display products in a visually appealing way.

Create a CSS file to apply custom styles.

Integrate Google Fonts for better typography.



6. Layout Management:

Set up a shared layout file to define consistent design elements (like navbar, footer) across all pages.

Use Razor layout features to ensure each page inherits the main layout.



7. Debugging and Troubleshooting:

Use browser inspect tools to troubleshoot CSS issues (e.g., image not displaying properly, fonts not applied correctly).

Add basic error handling to deal with potential issues like missing data, null references, or JSON parsing errors.



8. Iterative Enhancement:

After successfully displaying data, gradually enhance the UI with better styling, responsive design, and aesthetic improvements.

Emphasize clean separation of concerns by keeping data, business logic, and presentation code isolated into appropriate folders.

Best Practices to Follow:

Apply Single Responsibility Principle throughout.

Keep folder structure clear with separation into Models, Services, Pages, and wwwroot (static files).

Use Dependency Injection consistently to inject services.

Use Razor syntax effectively to blend HTML and C#.

Focus on maintainability so future changes (like switching from JSON to a real database) are easy.

Use GitHub for version control and keep commits meaningful, showing progress through these stages.

Final Goal:
The result should be a well-structured, beginner-friendly ASP.NET Core application that loads product data from a JSON file, displays it in a responsive grid, uses a consistent layout, and follows good architectural principle
